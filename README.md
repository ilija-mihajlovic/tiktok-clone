## Welcome to my TikTok clone repository!

This repository contains the code for a TikTok clone built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity. The app allows users to create and share short videos, as well as interact with other users through likes, comments, and followers.

Some of the key features of the app include:

 - A feed of popular videos
 - A user profile page with a list of their own videos and followers
 - User sign up through Google login
 - A video upload and editing page
 - The ability to like and comment on videos

This app is built with a modern stack, utilizing the power of Next.js for server-rendered React applications, and Tailwind CSS for fast and efficient styling. The app also uses Sanity as a headless CMS for storing and managing content.

I hope you find this repository useful as a reference for building your own TikTok clone, or as a starting point for your own video sharing app. Please feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have any suggestions or contributions to make.
